## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning solution for forecasting traffic demand using geospatial, temporal, environmental, and road infrastructure features.

The objective is to predict traffic intensity at a given location and timestamp by learning hidden patterns from historical transportation data. The solution combines advanced feature engineering with gradient boosting techniques to capture nonlinear relationships influencing traffic flow and demand.

<summary><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></summary>

### Key Findings

- More than 1200 unique geohash locations indicating high geographical diversity.
- Missing values primarily observed in RoadType, Temperature, and Weather.
- Demand distribution exhibited strong positive skewness.
- Significant variation in traffic demand across locations and road types.
- Road infrastructure and spatial features contributed most to predictive performance.

### Missing Value Treatment

**Numerical Features**
- Median Imputation

**Categorical Features**
- Mode Imputation

### Timestamp Processing

Timestamp values were decomposed into:

- Hour
- Minute

### Cyclical Encoding

```python
hour_sin = np.sin(2 * np.pi * hour / 24)
hour_cos = np.cos(2 * np.pi * hour / 24)
```

This preserves the cyclical nature of time.

### Geospatial Engineering

Hierarchical location features were extracted using:

```text
geohash
├── gh3
└── gh4
```

These features capture regional traffic patterns and location-based demand behavior.

### Target Transformation

```python
y = np.log1p(demand)
```

Logarithmic transformation was applied to reduce skewness and improve model learning stability.

<summary><b>Model Selection Rationale</b></summary>

Several machine learning algorithms were considered:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

CatBoost was selected because it provides:

- Native support for categorical variables
- Strong performance on structured tabular data
- Effective handling of high-cardinality features
- Minimal preprocessing requirements
- Robust generalization performance
